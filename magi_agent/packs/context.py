"""D5 typed-context ABI + dispatcher for the neutral microkernel.

Each primitive impl receives ONLY a narrow, typed, read-mostly context exposing
exactly its type's capabilities. First-party and user impls receive the SAME
object (no privileged handle). Contexts carry a frozen ``capabilities`` set that
is NOT gated in full-trust local (D6) but reserves the seam for a hosted build
to restrict capability without changing any impl signature.
