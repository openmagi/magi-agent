"""Action-honored assertions for the F-QA matrix harness.

Given a :class:`TriggerOutcome` and the matrix-declared expected action,
this module checks "did the runtime honor the contract for this combo?".
Each action has its own assertion path keyed off ``_LEGAL``-declared
semantics:

* ``audit`` — the runtime recorded an audit ledger entry (or an
  equivalent in-band signal) AND did not short-circuit the surrounding
  chokepoint. For mutator kinds (``output_rewrite`` / ``prompt_injection``)
  ``audit`` labels the "wrote mutation to ledger" semantics, so the
  asserter accepts a present mutation as evidence the rule fired.
* ``block`` — the runtime returned a short-circuit verdict
  (``ToolResult.status == "blocked"`` for tool slots, gate-block string
  for the pre-final llm_criterion seam, ``run_*_verdict == "block"`` for
  shell helpers, ``RequirementError``-shaped output for SHACL, the
  ``("deny", rule_id)`` pair for tool_perm).
* ``ask_approval`` — runtime emitted an ``ask`` verdict (the
  ``("ask", rule_id)`` pair for tool_perm; audit-only honest-degrade for
  llm_criterion / shell_check at non-tool-perm slots).
* ``retry`` — runtime surfaced a retry sentinel. The pre-final
  llm_criterion seam emits the same block reason for both retry and
  block actions today (retry is a presentation-layer label); the
  asserter accepts a non-empty block reason as evidence the gate fired.
* ``override`` — the after-tool ingestion gate returned an override dict
  (or, equivalently, the dispatched ``ToolResult.output`` differs from
  the original — covers the redact path).

Every assertion includes a precise (kind, slot, action, rule_id)
contextual message so a matrix-row failure points the operator at the
exact combo to investigate.

    Per-slot semantics (cross-references the runtime chokepoints + the
    relevant F-LIFE review-pass NOTEs):

    * ``before_compaction`` — audit-only by default; ``block`` action
      causes :meth:`MagiContextCompactionPlugin._apply_tail_trim` to
      RETURN EARLY without mutating ``llm_request.contents``. Asserter
      verifies the post-call contents are byte-identical to the pre-call
      contents on ``block`` rows.
    * ``after_compaction`` — audit-only by ``_LEGAL`` (block excluded).
      Asserter only confirms the trigger ran without raising; firing
      evidence is covered by the JudgePatcher.calls sanity check in the
      test body.
    * ``on_task_checkpoint`` — F-LIFE4a review-pass NOTE: only the
      ``claimed`` transition honors a true block; other transitions are
      audit-only. Asserter:
        - ``audit`` / ``ask_approval`` rows: the in-memory task moves to
          ``completed`` (the stub runner returns ``outcome="completed"``).
          ``ask_approval`` is honest-degrade today (audit only).
        - ``block`` rows: the task moves to ``failed`` with the
          ``customize_policy_blocked`` error sentinel; the driver does
          NOT advance to the runner.
    * ``on_artifact_created`` — block is honestly impossible (artifact
      already written by the provider). Asserter:
        - ``audit`` rows: the decision MUST NOT carry the
          ``artifact_review_pending`` reason code.
        - ``ask_approval`` rows: the decision MUST carry
          ``requires_approval=True`` in ``diagnostic_metadata`` with
          ``approval_slot == "on_artifact_created"`` (the audit ledger's
          ``requires_approval=true`` marker per the F-LIFE4a wire).
    * ``on_task_complete`` — F-LIFE4b review-pass NOTE: the collector
      annotates audit records with ``requires_approval`` / ``gate_verdict``
      for block / ask actions, but no compensating-action wire (turn
      rollback) ships in v1. Asserter verifies the engine ran (turn
      proceeded) for every action — the ledger annotations are
      observability-only.
    * ``on_session_start`` — first-fire-per-session contract:
        - First call: ``audit`` ⇒ proceed (``None`` return); ``block`` ⇒
          synthetic policy-blocked ``LlmResponse`` whose
          ``error_message`` carries ``customize_policy_blocked:
          on_session_start`` (the plugin's helper).
        - Second call (same session): MUST short-circuit and return
          ``None`` regardless of action — the membership check fires
          before the policy load.
    * ``spawn`` — capability_scope deterministic subtraction:
        - The ``denyTools=["shell_exec"]`` payload removes ``shell_exec``
          from the resolved toolset. Asserter verifies ``shell_exec``
          appears in ``removed_tool_names`` and the remaining toolset
          equals the original minus the deny entry.

    Asserter does NOT inspect the audit ledger directly — the test body's
    ``JudgePatcher.calls`` sanity check is responsible for "the rule
    fired at all". Each branch surfaces a precise failure message so a
    failing matrix row identifies the offending combo.

    Routes shell_command / shell_check matrix rows authored by

    shape regardless of slot. The F-QA1 / F-QA2 / F-QA4 asserters
    (which route via slot, not kind) cannot be reused here because
    they assume per-slot trigger shapes (facade ToolResult / governed
    turn items / FileDeliveryDecision) that the shell fan-out
    triggers do not produce.

    Per-action contract:

    * ``audit`` — at least one audit record in
      ``{executed, evaluated, budget_exhausted}`` AND ``runtime_verdict``
      is not ``block``. ``budget_exhausted`` is honored as evidence the
      gate fired (the cross-kind budget test exercises this path
      explicitly).
    * ``block`` — ``runtime_verdict == "block"`` OR (at audit-only
      siblings where the gate cannot short-circuit) at least one
      audit record carries a non-zero exit code as the in-band
      "block-shaped" signal.
    * ``ask_approval`` — honest-degrade today (audit-only). Accept an
      audit record OR a ``proceed`` / ``ask`` verdict.

    Honest-degrade for shell_check at slots without a v1 helper: the
    trigger sets ``side_effects["honest_degrade"]=True`` so the
    asserter short-circuits to a friendly skip — the validator
    accepts the row for forward-compat authoring but the runtime
    ships no fan-out helper to drive.
