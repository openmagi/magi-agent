## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 0.1.25

### Added
- `magi doctor` now runs real environment diagnostics: provider configuration,
  the `litellm` dependency, config-file readability, and workspace writability.
- Documentation: "What works today" capability page, a "Common tasks → command"
  index, a Telegram/Discord channels guide, an in-session (slash) commands guide,
  a glossary, and this changelog.

### Changed
- Local TUI approval UX now includes the current approval flow improvements and
  transcript rendering uplift from the post-0.1.24 mainline.
- Documentation now clearly separates the local CLI's real execution (a provider
  key enables a real model plus first-party tools behind permission prompts) from
  the enforcement/governance layer, which ships default-off (shadow).
- Configuration docs split local CLI setup (one provider key) from deployment
  variables that the local CLI does not need.

### Fixed
- Local dashboard and CLI chat now keep runner policy routing scoped to each
  runtime driver instance instead of mutating a process-global env override.
- Hosted phase selection now uses the live task profile for routing decisions.
- Streaming dashboard control requests now render and resolve correctly.
- Runner-policy phase routing is no longer default-on, preventing unintended
  model downgrades from stale routing metadata.
- Corrected default model ids in the docs to match the runtime
  (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-5.5`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `kimi-k2-instruct`).
- Authority-flag env vars now documented with the real `CORE_AGENT_PYTHON_` prefix.
- Fixed an evidence-contract example that used snake_case triggers
  (`after_tool_use`) instead of the valid `afterToolUse`/`beforeCommit` tokens.
- Documented that headless one-shot `magi -p` in `default` mode cannot resolve
  tool approvals (use `--permission-mode acceptEdits`/`bypassPermissions` or the
  interactive TUI); corrected the tool catalog count and added `MemoryWrite`.
